# Learn AngularJS

This is a sample project, where I am going to explore and experiment different web functionalities with AngularJS core capabilities.

The base of the project is taken from Pro AngularJS book by Adam Freeman (published by APress).

I am going to extend the base solution with new functionalities and change existing implementations to make it more complex and challenging.

Please feel free to send the Pull requests with specific comments, I will evaluate and accept the changes.

To give you guys a feel, this is how the home page will look like -
